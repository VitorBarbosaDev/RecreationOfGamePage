    <h2>About Me!</h2>
    <p>Hi, I’m Vitor Barbosa, a game developer with a passion for creating immersive and engaging gaming experiences. I have a degree in game development from IT Sligo and a specialization in software development from Atlantic Technological University.</p>
    <p>I have experience working with various programming languages, including C++, C#, Python, Java, and Prolog, and I have worked with popular game engines such as Unity and Unreal. Some of my notable projects include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Space Yard Dodge: a 2D Android ship shooter game with over 100 downloads on Play Store.</li>
        <li>Death Race for U: a 3D Windows online multiplayer racing game with weapons, built using netcode for game objects to connect players. I wrote my degree thesis on this project.</li>
        <li>Auto-Generating: a 2D Android top-down rogue-like game built on Unity top-down engine, currently in development.</li>
        <li>Block Party: a 3D Windows party game with multiple mini-games and couch co-play, developed in a team.</li>
        <li>Punch Party: a 3D Windows boxing game with character customization and intelligent AI fights, developed with a small team of two.</li>
    </ul>

   <p>Aside from game development, I enjoy exploring new technologies and techniques in software development, engaging with the software development community, and creating my own games as a hobby.</p>
